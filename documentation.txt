in errorhandler.ts 
we are using class (ie oops) object oriented so that using that object we can call class wherever we need to handle error throughout the project
extends error (here error is like function name )so we can call it anywhere

and here we are using naming convention for file like (user.model.ts) here user is the entity that is 
it has user related entity and 
model is the file that has model in it

password is hashed before storing in db by bcrypt

in user.model server sends 2 cookies (refreshtoken and accesstoken)
access token is expired in 5min
and refresh token will take long time
when access token is going to expire then our refresh token automatically generates access token
so due to repeated changes in access token it is highly secured
to get new access token by refresh token we will be hitting new api line GET/api/user/refresh


user controller and user route is for api work both are inter related

facebook and instagram uses this type of authentication by refreshing access token every 5min
